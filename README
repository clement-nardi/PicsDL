The pics-dl project is composed of of two modules and has two dependencies:

Modules:
 - PicsDL: the main application		
 - WPDInterface: a library to access smartphones and cameras, based on Microsoft's Windows Portable Device API
	 
External dependencies:
 - libexif: used to read exif tags and thumbnails from picture files
 - exiftool: used to geo-tag the pictures
 - o2: OAuth library for QT
		
Technical constraints:
 - The WPDInterface library can only be built with MS Visual Studio
 - PicsDL and the libexif must be built with the same compiler. If you intend to build with static linking, it must even be the exact same compiler version.
 - libexif only provides compilation procedure using MinGW/MSYS, so it is strongly advised to compile PicsDL with MinGW (using QT Creator).
 
Step-by-step guide to compile PicsDL:
 1. Download
	QT			: http://download.qt-project.org/official_releases/qt/5.3/5.3.2/qt-opensource-windows-x86-mingw482_opengl-5.3.2.exe
	Git			: http://git-scm.com/download/win
	exiftool	: http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/exiftool-9.77.zip
	libexif		: http://sourceforge.net/projects/libexif/files/libexif/0.6.21/libexif-0.6.21.zip/download
	MSYS/MinGW 	: https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/latest/download
	Optional but recommended:
	notepad++	: http://download.tuxfamily.org/notepadplus/6.6.9/npp.6.6.9.Installer.exe
	
 2. Install (in whatever order)
	2.1 QT
		On the 3rd step, make sure you select all the Tools (including MinGW).
		Otherwise just click on Next
	2.2 Git
		Just click Next.
	2.3 MinGW/MSYS
		The full install procedure is here: http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Getting_Started
		Short install procedure:
		 - Leave default options and click Next until you reach the "Installation Manager"
		 - right-click on mingw-developer-toolkit, and mark for installation
		 - go to menu Installation / Apply Changes
		 - close the Installation Manager
	2.4 Notepad++	 
		Just click Next.
		 
 3. Download the sources
	Choose a folder where to download the sources
	right-click on this folder and choose "Git Bash"
	In the terminal, write:
		git clone https://code.google.com/p/pics-dl/
	
 4. Compile the libexif
	4.1 Prepare the build
		Go to folder C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\etc\ and rename the file "fstab.sample" into "fstab"
		Edit the file fstab (right-click / Edit with Notepad++)
		On the line 16, replace "c:/mingw" by "C:/Qt/Qt5.3.2/Tools/mingw482_32"
		Save the file
	4.2 Build
		Extract the content of libexif-0.6.21.zip at the root of the repository.
		You will then find the build procedure in pics-dl/libexif-0.6.21/README-Win32.txt
		Open MSYS/MinGW by launching C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\msys.bat
		In the terminal, write these commands:
			cd /e/.../pics-dl/libexif-0.6.21/        # /e/ is the drive letter. Replace ... by the actual location of the git repository
			./configure
			make
			make install
		If successful, this file should be created: */pics-dl/libexif-0.6.21/libexif/.libs/libexif-12.dll
 5. Compile PicsDL
		Double-click on */pics-dl/PicsDL/PicsDL.pro
		let QT Creator configure the project automatically
		click on the compile button (green triangle)
